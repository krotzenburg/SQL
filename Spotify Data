For this project I uploaded Spotify Data from 2021 
- then I checked various statistics on the data to understand it 

Here is creating the data table
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL );

Then I started looking at the dataset to see what is in it
SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

I wanted to see what the longest songs were
SELECT track_name, duration_ms
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms desc;

Checked the data out more
SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;
 
 What is the most danceable song??
SELECT artist_name, AVG(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP by artist_name
ORDER BY AVG(danceability) desc; 

Which artist had the most songs in the top 50?
SELECT artist_name, COUNT(artist_name)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY COUNT(artist_name) desc;

In case you were wondering the last ones answer was: Olivia Rodrigo!!
